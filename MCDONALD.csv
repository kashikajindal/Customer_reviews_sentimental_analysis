the heavy set woman with the short cut quick weave with glasses is very rude and miserable looking . i stood there waiting on the doordash order for 20 min and she didnt ask how could she help me she didn't say anything  she was skipping over the doordash order  and just let me stand there then when the order was done she threw the bag,2 stars

"Delivery- complete joke! Don't bother taking the time to order sauces for your Nuggets! I ordered 20 spicy,  40 reg, picked out at least 9 different dipping sauces as ""required "" not to mention Desired by my kiddos!! We did NOT get ONE sauce or even a ketchup!!! Just to make sure they were consistant with disregard, they didn't even give us straws either to go with our $3 mango smoothies...2 of them! So, 60 Nuggets-NO sauces  AT ALL!  Not the first time they have done us wrong on the Nuggets so buyer should be cautious!",2 stars
"f I could give it -5 I would. Ordered on their own mobile app so it seems like they chose not to read /deliver the order actually ordered. I collected , drove 10 + minutes towards home before the kid figured out that his order had every single add on we had requested not be added. I called and , zero apology,  was told to drive back to the drive thru and collect. OH-KAY. Lovely customer service already. I get there and the 'manager' asks me to return the wrong order, I handed it back (untouched) and he made  huge scene of firing it in the trash. emmmm, your mistake. No apology and ALL the attitude ? Never , ever again. Calling the franchise owner. I would hate this guy to represent my business . I felt so sorry for his team mates /peers who were embarrassed by him.",1 star
"The interior was something I'd never seen before. There were planted boards you could use to place your order before reaching the counter, but the line was short so it wasn't needed. The place was clean and all the orders were right. It was a nice stop for a sit-down quick lunch like how fast food should be.",5 stars
"The person who takes your order always seems to be mad, the cashier is never polite and orders are almost always wrong. Good thing other better places to eat are around here.",1 star
"This location has a fun indoor playroom area. The play equipment always seems to be clean and well-maintained. I take my two-year-old granddaughter there occasionally, and she always has fun. The only reason for the four out of five stars is because their projection screen/interactive play mat has not worked properly since we have been visiting there over the last year. It has partially worked on a couple of occasions and my granddaughter remembers that she enjoyed it. Every time weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re there she stomps on it to try to make it work. She will grab my hand and pull me over to the mat and try and get me to make it work. I",4 stars
Good quick service! But the lady that works at night front counter is very rude. It's a way to say something. People are spending their money.,1 star
"When the order is correct, the quality is fine. But I never get an order completely correct, especially if it's a McCafe drink. I would let it go, everyone makes mistakes, but it's constant and employees as a manager have had a terrible attitude about fixing it. If there were another one to go to instead, I would.",3 stars
"Went through the drive thru in a hurry to get my daughter to school, we found a hair in our food and was given the wrong drink. The manager on duty was very apologetic and gave me a refund. Even though I was disappointed with the hair in the food, we were treated very kindly and had no problem getting our money back",2 stars
"I'll always come back here. The food's always right and the store and bathroom is always clean. Nobody bothers you. I even ate pizza here and the management didn't seem to care and it's a good place to eat and work. There aren't too many good McDonald's you can find a good plug in for your laptop but this one is awesome.

The staff is good and very helpful every time I go there. One day I was low on money but really had to eat. One of the guys who worked there gave me a break and upsized my drink as a courtesy. It was hot as $h&t outside and I had a longer lasting drink to curve the heat.",5 stars
"Actually an especially above average location.  Service and food are what should be expected.  Clean.  Restroom has hands free door opener.  Kids Play Place is especially nice.  Has modern play equipment, toddler area and interactive life size video game station.",5 stars
"So I gave this a 3, mainly because they always get my order right. The customer service is not always there. Its hit or miss. Please Beware! The drive-thru has a narrow turn, I've seen too many cars scrape up the side hitting the barrier at the first window. It doesn't look like you're that close, but I promise, just take a wide turn in the drive-thru",3 stars
I can only speak to their breakfast as it's the only thing I've purchased there. Service is fast and the food is great.,5 stars
"Best McDonald's around!
The people who work there are always super nice, the service is very good compared to other McDonald's in this area. And there are NOT any of those horrible self serve kiosks! Oh how I hate those things!!!
The restaurant is clean and we'll maintained.
This is my favorite!",5 stars
We love coming here. Tried the Shamrock Mcflurry and it was delicious!,4 stars
Their employees needs to learn customer service.,4 stars
They made a mistake on my order but I hadn't left the parking lot yet. I called them and told them and they gave me the correct sandwich right away. Great service!,5 stars
"What makes this place 5 star to me is the Manager.......Nikko!

Nikko is super friendly, genuinely caring about HONEST customers and makes you wanna come back for some of his cheer.
Service is great here with seldom a mistake in the mornings when I come in.

Who doesn't love McDonalds fries... quick service it always fast not really a long wait... Mmmmmm fries.....,5 stars
"Love this spot. Convenient location right off of major highways, food is prepared properly, drive-thru turns over quickly, coffee is delicious. No complaints. This is what every McDonald's should be like.",5 stars
"Fast service, hot fries fresh burgers. It's McD's. Somehow the food is fresher in our drive thru only world...

People at this one always are nice considering they need to deal with peeps like me that never know what they want. It's been the same basic menu for decades. LOL",5 stars
"If I could give them no stars I would.. they have been messing up my order for year's. Remodel didn't help nothing,  still sucks. I've complained to a district manager,  don't help. I've had 1 nice manager,  but she still got my order wrong... I swear at one point I thought I was on boiling point, or there was a hidden camera. Cuz they got my order wrong 3x's in s row... this place is A JOKE....",1 star
It's a pretty nice McDonald's. Not highest quality of food of course cuz it's fast food but I like the fries and getting deals. I've tried the mobile order a few times too and it's cool how they bring it to you and feels like there's less wait.,4 stars
Absolute worst service. The manager has no control over her employees. Absolutely rude and unprofessional.,1 star
This place is the worst.  It smelled like manure.  I had to go to the counter like 3 times before the order was complete. Cold fries and burnt apple pies. I didnt like this olace at all.  Next birthday for my grandson will be somewhere else.,1 star
"Some people still swear that McDonald's has the best coffee. It's not my personal favorite, but it's good and inexpensive. Discounts for seniors. Love the value meal selections too.",5 stars
Very clean lobby and facility. Coffee was fresh. Service was quick.,4 stars
The kiddos love to stop by and play in the play places.  This location has a bathroom in the play area which is awesome for the potty training years.  The resturant and play area was very clean and staff was around every so often to check on the cleaniness.  This is one of our favorite locations to visit.,5 stars
Classic fast food with addictive french fries. Burgers are prepared and cooked the same across the US. Consistency and quality are worth each visit.,4 stars
Always enjoy this McDonald's and I am not a fan of the food. The food is hot and correct majority of the time. The play area is great and staff is friendly. Keep up the good work.,4 stars
They were wicked fast and very friendly! I had actually stopped going to any McDonalds because of bad experiences elsewhere with really dry nuggets. Did not regret getting food there today.,5 stars
"Always fast, their food always tastes much more delicious than other mcdonalds.",4 stars
Urger buns taxted stale. Fries were little more than broken potato sticks. Absolutely terrible location!,2 stars
"Clean play area for children, minimal staff but working hard. I asked for veggie sandwhich because I am a vegitarian, i said ""lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, onion stuff like that"" but my sandwhich came out with pickles and cheese. :0( they took it back put a tomatoe and 1 peace of lettuce on it. I wish McDonalds had a nice big veggie sandwich to fill me up.",4 stars

Took my 3 year old here to eat and play in the play place. There was a homeless man sitting in there with his no socks or shoes on. Multiple employees walked by him without saying anything,1 star
"What's with the weak coffee?! The McDonald's coffee usually has a great flavor, this morning its like dirty warm water, weak and diluted! During breakfast lunch, unacceptable!",1 star
"I've never had a good experience with any McDonald's I've ever been to, so I usually avoid McD if possible.  My only visit to this McDonald's in Roanoke messed up my order.  I had ordered 2 hamburgers with no mustard, fries and drink.  I get home only to discover that the hamburgers did not have ketchup and onions, but were instead covered in mustard.  Won't be back.",1 star
They are doing a remodel for the lobby. But the drive through was open. Associate was very nice and we had a nice conversation while waiting on the food.,5 stars
"They have big macs :) but no all day breakfast :(... mobile app works well though, make sure you activate the order when u arrive ""I'M HERE"" or no one will know what you're talking about",4 stars
Drive thru lady is awful. The service was horrible,1 star
Girl taking orders in the drive through didn't listen very well. Asked for 2 hashbrowns it was never added to my order. I said it 3 times.,2 stars
Ordered a Big Mac with bacon didn't get the bacon on it. Fries were cold. And the gentleman inside was spitting in the trash can ill never go back again,1 star
You are sure of a good meal every time! Had a great brunch there today.,5 stars
Awesome vanilla cones!!,4 stars
"My over 20 year experience with McDonald's Restaurants in this area (Southlake, Grapevine, Keller, Northlake, and north FW) This one is by far the best one. I have been eating food regularly from this Roanoke McDonald's for a little over a year now.  This is the only place that makes the Big Mac the way I remember it as a kid. I do not post reviews often at all. I am making this one because of my experiences at all of the area McDonalds. If you decide to eat McDonald's, go to this one.",5 stars
That was the best quarter pounder I've had in years! .for real! Every once in awhile it's great. I would have taken a picture...but I wasn't thinking. Picture perfect,5 stars
The ladies restroom smell horrible. Moldy and mildew-y smell. Very very strong smell that I could smell through my mask.,2 stars
This location had me pull up to a number lane and wait for my food and NEVER CAME with it!! wth!!,1 star
Charged me for someone else who already drove offs meal. Then got my order wrong. Spent 20 minutes for fast food in the drive thru,2 stars
"Order some food and they forgot to give me , my Cheeseburgers... I always check the bag before I leave. I told them and the girl said it was in there...I told her you want to come and check...",2 stars
"Ate inside,  food was fine and order was correct.    Overall was a good visit.    Just wish was a little cleaner of a restaurant.",4 stars
"The service at this McDonald's is always spotty, this time they made my iced latte a hot latte not a big deal but they consistently mess up the orders and I love McDonalds in general",2 stars
We go to this McDonalds because they had a really cool electronic board that the kids could play on it was interactive and very neat well for the last five times they tell us the board is broke.. we only get a drink there I'm so we only go to for the play area and since it's broke my son has been very sad,2 stars
I think this place is under new management. I had a quarter pounder and it was really good and made right. Friendly service and very clean.,4 stars
"Great neighborhood McD. It's not open 24/7, but has enough friendly staff to keep its drive through going while quickly serving your order if you're inside.",5 stars
17 minutes in the drive thru. . . ..just wow.. had the order incorrect at the pay window. . .food was extremely hot so that was nice.,1 star

"Good food,friendly service and pretty quick as well",5 stars
It's ok food wise mostly I've had few issue with my coffee so I don't get coffee anymore there but the workers are very attentive and nice..,3 stars
Guys just to let you know. I hate McDonald's!.... I just keep coming back and knowing that's its killing me. What I'm trying to say is that im addicted and I cant stop eating. I eat because I'm unhappy and I'm unhappy cause I eat. Lol 5 star,5 stars
"Clean and good service. The only problem is the drive through window always open because the busy order during morning, flies get in easily.",4 stars
"Came here for McDonald's, was not disappointed.... Loved the arches, some lady hit the curb behind me, kinda funny. Food and service were great.",4 stars
Manager waited on lacked enthusiasm. Team member stocking lids napkins and straws didn't bother stepping aside for customers to get their articles needed.,3 stars
"They get the order right, the good is always hot.  The kids enjoy the play place and the whole place is clean.",4 stars
How do you miss a patty on a big mac? -_- First time going there too.,2 stars
Horrible customer service. Manager is a very unhappy person who obviously does not want to be there.,1 star
"I used the drive through to order food before going to work. Service was a little slower than usual, but food was hot.",3 stars
Flavorless grease bombs. This chain in general has gone down hill in a big way.,1 star
Rude on the drive thru speaker and at the window the only postive was the person who  gave me my food. She was very kind and polite to me.,2 stars
"Best mc Donalds EVA!!!
they made for me fresh coffee (super quick) , and the cookies were just baked, you made my night guys!",5 stars
Sat in the drive thru for about 15 to 20 min because they were very busy and still got very cold food. Took the fries back. Very disappointed.,2 stars
Took my nephew to play & eat. First one ive been to with a working interactive floor projection game. Suited my needs,4 stars
I was told to pull forward and park so I did and I waited for 30 minutes and when I went in to ask about my food they said they forgot about me. I got a refund and left.,1 star
Not a big fan of McDonald's but I do love their fries and cheeseburgers!,4 stars
The staff is rude. My orders are seldom correct. Management is indignant when you call with an issue.,1 star
This is a McDonald's so the food is normal and good I liked the service here and would come again,4 stars
They always mess up orders or give you the wrong order.  Many times the orders or not like instructed. Not too happy with this place!,1 star
"They did not give me my complete order, I made 3 order  of chicken deluxe and my order was missing fries whet back to made a complain and they were yelling at me and husband, this is not fear to the customer. People should be aware  of this  Mcdonald at Broadway and check their food properly before they leave drive thru. Those staff there are thief.",1 star
"There was an excruciating 15 minute wait time for two simple breakfast sandwiches, and the place was empty. When checked, the sandwiches were actually missing the cheese.
While waiting, some filthy guy was exchanging $80 in singles for twenties. After he got done with his banking transaction, he actually spun around and walked right into me- talk about the bum rush!!
The true danger here, though, is when you try to enter. There is a welcome sign at the curb directing cars to enter into a single lane driveway where the drive-thru actually exits. A head-on collision waiting to happen.
Stay far away from this place.",1 star
Good price clean and good services,5 stars
"Very bad service, I don't recommend to go there. 30 minutes waiting for a order and nobody say nothing.",1 star
I ordered a Big Mac meal sized medium and a 10 pc; I got a double cheeseburger and actually 5 McNuggets. Got robbed for nearly 10 dollars. Never again.,1 star
They are very rude and have no respect for people they yell at you like you did something wrong then the make you wait for your order then they get the order wrong and the best part nobody there speaks any English burger King for me,1 star
"Terrible service through the drive by. They threw out food into the bag and it isn't the first time. I use to come here alot as a kid, but growing up it got worse. I hope their employees can have better customer service. And don't throw food everywhere.",1 star
It's McDonald's! One of the most ratchetest places you can visit for fast food,5 stars
"Sun Dec 11, 2022 at 5: 30am, went to pick up a order lady was being very rude telling me to get out of her drive thru when all I said was I have a order to pick. Very unprofessional.",1 star
"The worst. Attitudes. Cold fries..twice!!!! The clerk gave the cleaning guy my order in the middle of him sweeping the floor, to bring to my car. Unsanitary!!!
2nd time....the order was still wrong.
Food wasn't good at all. Won't be going back.",2 stars
Incorrect hours!!!  I arrived at 5:52 in the morning and was informed that they still closed,2 stars
"Complicated kiosk ordering, salty fries (can order lightly salted) decent but too much sodium in the hamburgers.  Good for in a pinch or for a quick bite.",2 stars
"Went thru the drive thru. It was around 11:30 pm, and the line went all the way around the building but was moving. Only ordered 2 large decaf coffees. They were fresh - made to order.",5 stars
"Instead of the manager (Isiah) helping my kids, he decides to send someone else so he can go converse with someone else. They were paying customers just like everyone else he helped. Thank you to the people that helped my kids.",1 star
Food isn't always hit. Nonmatter when I go. And even if I order a kids meal we always have to pull around and wait for our order. It's very slow service,3 stars
"Sign indicates free item if the person taking your order doesn't ask about rewards. The Male taking our order didn't ask. We told them at the window. The manager told us the girl that took our order did ask us we explained that it wasn't a girl it was the man. To which she rolled her eyes,walked away and didn't return. We also didn't recieve our bottle water, napkins  nor straws for the drinks we did get.",1 star
"Tiny cramped parking lot makes it hard to get in and out of. Location is in a really commercial touristy area so it's to be expected, I suppose. Didn't go inside, so this is just the drive thru experience. Dual drive thru lines were wrapped around the building at 10pm on a Sunday.
Food ok. Fries and fish bun were a bit stale, considering the long line, was expecting fresher food, I guess.  Good enough for a late snack.",3 stars
This store is always clean. The staff always pleasant and helpful. I've been impressed with them the whole 7 months I've been here.,5 stars
"Lucky they even get the rating they do. Placed a mobile app order at 9:49am and was still waiting for 3 sandwiches 45 minutes later. Not a single person acknowledged me standing at the front counter, but had no problem passing orders out to those using the kiosk. Go thru the drive thru to be given the excuse that their ""short handed"", yet I spent 45 minutes INSIDE and seen plenty of employees. My order was wrong twice. Absolutely cold food. Sent a complaint to corporate because this is unacceptable. This location is full of tourist and I hate for these people visiting our state and area to be treated the way I was. Absolutely uncalled for!",1 star
Excellent and fast service. The food was good.,5 stars
"Typical McDonalds but extremely long waits due to proximity to tourist attractions.  Be prepared to wait 20+ mins in the drive thru, even for a mobile order",4 stars
"Food was cold drinks missing
The manager is rude the advertising is false. She accused us of lieing when we said we weren't asked about the rewards to receive the free cookie.  Very hostile !",1 star
"Quick food, pretty clean environment, cheap food. It's a McDonald's, they don't vary too much in general. Though there are outliers, this one is consistent with what I've come to expect of McDonald's.",5 stars
"TERRIBLE SERVICE!
Asked for the manager for refil e he turn around and started to do another thing completely different. ZERO ATTENTION TO CUSTOMER. Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿",1 star

Thank you Ileanna for the great coroner service. Keep up the great work!!",4 stars
What a wild location. Went here twice while on vacation and each time there were police near by. People darting across the parking lot.,3 stars
"For a McDonalds I was pleased. Ordered at a kiosk, but they brought us our food to the table. Order was correct and food arrived quickly. Quite clean.",4 stars
No one to take your order it's all done on kiosks had to have my ice coffee remade because they couldn't get it right the first time,2 stars
"I understand the profit-drive to push automation, but it seems to not work here. 35 minutes wait for two standard egg McMuffin meals mid morning is unacceptable for fast food.",1 star
Very long wait time but the food was good and the young lady at the second window was so nice,5 stars
Lost our order. Waited 45 min for a burger fries and a box of nuggets. Then they accuse us of trying to get a duplicate order for Free. They clearly have problems.  We tossed a twenty dollar bill at them and asked for the food. NEVER GO to this location.  EVER,1 star
"I needed a quick meal will on break at the Gaylord Palm business convention.

Pros: any location Im at from Shenzhen China to Hawaii to Orlando I can count on McDonalds when I land. They keep the same consistent taste world wide. as a business owner this is admirable. This location was efficient and fast.

Cons: we all know it's not the healthiest food but that had nothing to do with the location
So I only ate it once on my 5 day stay.
McDonald's should explore healthier options for the current market . But still a great experience

10 out of 10.

Stars : 5 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½",5 stars
Always clean and super fast ordering on the app,5 stars
I had the worst experience at this location. I went to the drive thru and only ordered 2 hamburgers and a small fry. I paid and pulled up to get my food and was given the wrong order. I let the associate know it wasn't correct. He had me pull up to the wait window to get my correct food. As I sat and waited time was just ticking by. After 15 minutes of patiently waiting I wanted my food. No one came back. I knocked on the glass and no response. As about the 10th car received there food at the window behind me I had to get out of the car and walk back to that window as it was late and the inside was closed. I asked where my food was and he said he was making it. I asked for a refund and was given my slip refund a total of 28 minutes after first paying. I went back in the next day to speak with a manager to let them know that this happened. I had my receipt with the time and the refund receipt with the time 28 minutes later. He said oh I'm sorry they're new. Terrible customer service and uncaring management.,1 star
"Service was trash, took them 20 minutes to take my order (no exaggerations... Seriously), can't even salt fries for some reason, and the employees weren't able to organize correctly. For example, at one point, there were three employees gathered around to fill one order. ONE ORDER!!!! Seriously??? I'd recommend going somewhere else then to spend your time and money here.",1 star

Worst MCdonalds experience ever. 40 minutes and counting and no order. Don't ever stop here unless you want to get extremely mad,1 star
Employee was rude but it fine ï¿½ï,4 stars
"Waited in the drive thru for literally an hour. If we weren't trapped in line and had been able to leave we would have. They didn't give us any napkins and got our order wrong. The cashier said it's ""always like this"". Absolutely not acceptable. Especially for a McDonald's. Did they forget what FAST food means!?",2 stars
"Food was hot, but service a little slow.  Honestly, though, I've paid 5 times more at Disney and waited for about 5 times as long.  So, putting it in relative perspective, it wasn't that bad for this area.  We're going again this morning (I'm not a fast food fan, but hotel breakfast is just pastries), so I'll update the review if my experience is different.  If I were a local, though, I'd avoid this whole tourist-trap area on Irlo Bronson.",3 stars
Service was terrible wouldn't allowed to use the app couldn't redeem point wouldn't let us use gift card I think they were pocketing the cash they overcharged us and forgot Burger,1 star
"I'm sorry to give only one star. But during our visit were in the children's area 7 of 7 tables or seats are not clean. It was uncomfortable for me to sit there. There were many spots to see, unappetizing. if the area for the guests looks like, how is it in the kitchen. I do not want to imagine it. I will not go there a second time.",1 star
I felt so bad about how crazy busy they were that I wanted to jump behind the counter and help hand out bags! They did the best they could considering how hectic it was... and it was 11pm. It was pretty cool to see the kiosk that you can order from. Much rather order my food through that than a person.,3 stars
Kind of touch and go with this location. Sometimes they're very attentive and sometimes they don't listen when you're trying to give them your order. Late night is when I've generally had problems with their service. Otherwise they are pretty good.,4 stars
I placed my order at 7:33pm tonight and got the order at about 8:15pm.  I had to call to make sure they received my order. Apparently they either forgot or overlooked it.  Usually they would throw in a free item to make you happy..   not this place.,1 star
"This was the worst McDonald's I've been in. We ordered using the kiosk and  they had numbers to pick up and take to your table where they would deliver your food. We waited 20 minutes for the food and it was dropped on our table without any courtesy. The coffee I ordered was missing as was the cup for my husband's drink. He went to the counter to get it and they didn't believe him at first. My coffee had the label on it for what I'd ordered but it didn't have any sugar in it so I added one and stirred it, took a sip and got a mouthful of grounds. The egg and sausage mcmuffin was cold as were the hash browns and  the coffee was tepid. I assume it had been ready quite a while before it was delivered. Usually when I get this meal things are quite hot. The whole thing was pretty dissatisfying and put me off McDonald's for a while. The staff didn't seem to be receptive to complaints so I made an online complaint on the McDonald's website and we left.",1 star
"I placed an order about an hour ago only to find out that half of my order was missing. I called this location to let them know that I was missing half my order. The manager, Judith, stated that if I don't come before 4am them I'd have to wait until the next day to receive my order. Although I do understand that their menu items are schedule based, I think its highly unprofessional to turn their problem into mine. I understand that my items were not available after that time, but she was extremely unhelpful in finding a solution to the problem they created. I asked to speak to a manager and was told the manager is on vacation. The call ended with her stating that she does not have time to deal with my problem because they are ""too busy"".",1 star
"I want to apologize to anyone that I recommended this particular McDonald's to in the past.
This was the restaurant that I used to recommend to tourists when they were looking for a fast place to eat that was away from the Disney parks, but still close enough to get back to the parks quickly. At that time, it was worth it. The menu was cheap (or at least what you know to expect from a international chain) and, since it's a chain, you know what the food is gong to be like.
So, let's look at what you need to do if you are a member of a chain of restaurants. You need to set yourself apart with your service. This WAS the reason I used to recommend this restaurant. Sadly, I don't think they care anymore. The last time we went, half of the kiosks weren't working. One of the three that was, didn't print receipts. (This plays a part into why the service was so atrocious. Actually there was a lot that played into it.) Now, if you've gone to McDonald's at all recently, you know you pick your food at the kiosk, get a number that you take to your table, pay at the kiosk, sit down and wait for your food. Typically all of that takes about five minutes. Well, this day (and what I've garnered from tourists and locals, on many other days) the team at work decided they weren't going to bring the food to the table. That would have been fine if there was any indication ANYWHERE, but of course that would have been a form of service so that didn't happen. After about 15 minutes of trying to find a place where we could all sit together (only a slight exaggeration) we were told by other customers that were leaving that they weren't calling numbers and you had to wait at the counters.
Ok... So I go up to the counter and wait. We get our food 40 minutes later, and there were the obligatory mess ups that we had to get corrected. No big deal, we are used to this.
My in-laws are visiting and at this point I'm trying to figure why they haven't received their order. It dawned on me  that my father in-law doesn't have a receipt (remember the machine that wasn't printing receipts?).
The person calling numbers is calling the number on the receipt, not the tent number. Apparently, my in-laws food was ready in a master of minutes (amazing since that is all customized) and placed in the ""abandoned order"" area. If we hadn't said anything, they would never have received their food. The lady never once called a tent number. We told another person of the lack of receipt problem. That information never got transmitted to the person calling the numbers. When we spoke with her and told her their was no receipt, she asked us what the receipt number was. We had the tent card in hand and pointed at the receipt plastered on the ice cream machine, and she asked again for the receipt.
Aside from the travesty that was the most important thing a restaurant is to do, the place looked like a slightly cleaned up version of a break room at a local dump. I'm not sure if they just didn't staff well on this shift, but like I said, I've talked to a few tourists and locals and they all say it had been this way a while.",1 star
"The only reason that I stoped to buy at McDonald's was because of my youngest daughter. But what we experienced today put an end to it. The employees at this location did not maintain an order serving  customers in the drive thru area. As you noticed, there are two lines in the drive thru and they are supposedly serve in a first come first serve basis but that was not the case. The associate, instead of been polite, talked to us in a not too pleasant tone. I did not wanted to make things worst so we placed our order and moved on to pay and pick up. Luckily the manager was close by and had the opportunity to address the experience. I hope they take this opportunity to improve their customer service skills and provide customers a much pleasant experience.",2 stars
"Really slow service, took over 15 minutes to receive the food,  after it had been delivered to another table.

When it did arrive, the chicken and burger were cold. Duly sent back, to be fair they were remade and brought pretty quick, but no apology.",1 star
Take the extra 5 minutes to go to a different location!!!! My entire order was incorrect and stuffed into one bag which broke 2 seconds after it was handed to me. The person who took my order was more interested in rushing me then looking to see if it was correct. Went inside to speak with a manger and turns out she was the one who bagged my order! I then got screamed at by some young wanna be Rico suave who shouldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been in the kitche,1 star
"Always a favorite, McD's is still serving up all the favorites - we were there for breakfast and had a short wait. Alas, no dining room availability at this location for now. Very reasonable prices, of course, and some delicious NEW breakfast pastries!",4 stars
"I stopped here yesterday for a quick breakfast on my way to work. I got a bacon, egg and cheese mcgriddle, the hash brown and a caramel frappe. I ended up with food poisoning ï¿½ï¿½ï¿",2 stars
Normally I would give this restaurant five stars but today service was really slow. I placed an order for two Egg McMuffins & a large french vanilla coffee. My wait time was approximately 10 minutes. I also believe on this particular day the restaurant was understaffed. Again usually this restaurant is a five-star McDonald's just not on this day.,4 stars
"First time I had been to a McDonald's in America. It's certainly nothing special, but there isn't anything wrong with the location.

Food was fine and it was cool to try the different items from the menu. Also, yes, french fries taste the same whether you buy them from the UK or America.",5 stars
"I will admit this was a first at this location as it is always so busy when I arrived there was a line almost out to the street and this is a double drive through was worried I would be there a while but only took about ten mins as they moved quick and to my surprise my fries were fresh and hot. Best fries I have had in a while. Also got a cheeseburger and I must admit I was also pleased as I hate it when I decide to actually eat 1,000 calories and my cheese is thrown in my hamburger and not even melted yucky. But all was right on this last time. Good cheez burg& ï¿½ï",5 stars
"Ridiculous.. i am not one to ridicule, this is pure ridiculousness... I should not have to check behind people that are begging for higher wages and they can't even get a kids meal right... you forgot the nuggets and I also ordered fries and apples... I received  double fries,  no nuggets, as well as missing the sauces that were to accompany the nuggets. I tried calling when I arrived back. No one answered the phone!!! Here is your negative review that could've been rectified with you answering the phone to address these issues",1 star
"Slowest McDonald's I have ever been to in my life. Took an hour just to order in drive thru... Then took another 20 minutes just to get our food (orders 2 burgers, apple pie, and 20pc nugget so shouldn't have taken to long at all",1 star
"Busy, under staffed, slow service, condiment stand a mess, out of lids, ketchup dispenser broken.  I ordered to eat in and my food was delivered to my table in a to go bag!  Why take a number and have an associate bring a to go bag to the table????  Very,  very ill-run and poorly  managed location.  Just  awful.",1 star
I should never have to wait more than 5 to 10 minutes for fast food. Waiting for over 20 minutes in the line now and I still haven't gotten my food. I understand this is Midsummer but they knew this was coming before hand. They should have the staff and the facilities to handle the business demand. This McDonalds sucks,2 stars
"I love this place, I've been to this place for year's and not even one time a worker has been rude to me.",5 stars
Unnecessary long wait time in drive thru. Drive thru is built for double cars and double pick up windows but still stayed behind 4 cars for 30 minutes. Only waited due to long drive home with kids in the car. Rude staff as well. Really wish I had noticed the Burger King across the street earlier. I would have even settled for checkers across the street and that's saying a lot because I don't think anyone willingly eats at checkers,1 star
"McDonald's is ok. I just wish they wouldn't pester people in leaving while the kids are playing in the play place. I mean I get the no loitering, but we bought food, and kids are just trying to play and they didn't really finish their own good. They just wanted to enjoy the empty play area",3 stars
"I have ordered many times from this mcdonalds, how do you screw up a cheeseburger? I asked for no ketchup, no mustard, no pickles, no onion. I got no condiments and NO MEAT! I mean really, learn to read and pay attention. This is my 3rd time this has happened.",1 star
"Extremely rude and impatient. I asked for 3 water cups with my 40$ meal and I got a glare and only one cup.  Then my brother who ordered a 20 piece nugget went up to ask for sauce because they didn't include any that we asked for, after waiting patiently and then asking several times he got 2 of the 4 he asked for.  He came back frustrated with only 2 so I told him to go back for more. He asked the manager 4 times to her face very nicely for 2 more and she just looked at him each time and went the other way. Eventually a kind fellow customer next to him reached over the counter and just took sauce for my brother. Not impressed",1 star
Double check your orders. I got someone else order and when i took it back. The employee placed it back to give it to someone else. I told her I touched the burger to throw it away. She looked at my face and lie that she threw it away. Horrible attitude from the cashier. Order was not completed.,1 star
Female cashier was rude and was very unprofessional. If you are a tourist and don't know when it is cash only you don't get a receipt do not yell at the customer like we supposed to know what is going on. The only good thing about going was lemuel he was a great help. I would not want the girl to serve us with that attitude.,2 stars
"Long line at kisok, which was only way to order due to lack of staff. Difficulty using my coupon since ordered from kiosk. Tea was weak, had been sitting awhile. Terrible experience",1 star
"Worst customer service ever!! I was invited to come in after having to wait over 45 minutes on the drive thru. Manager Priscilla calls me to apologize and invites me back with my family, I explained I cannot come back next day, but would come following Sunday, she agreed and hung up. On Sunday I come to the restaurant and there is another manager Cynthia who I explained the situation and she grunted the whole time she took the order. While on the service line, she tries to contact the manager and right there from behind the line, she asks me yelling, what is your name, I tell her and again in front of EVERYONE, other customers included, yells again, ""she tells me you came in already!!"" I replied NO, at this point I'm embarrassed and upset and I hear her that she tells the person on the phone I already put it down. Twenty minutes later, I finally get the order. I ask her to change the fries on some of the things that were ready because they were cold. The manager grunts and agrees to. After my family were done with their meals, we had ordered ice cream and we asked to hold off until we were done. When we returned, we asked for the ice cream and we had asked for chocolate, they said that we had ordered vanilla and the manager gave us one less of what we ordered. Incredible! Bottom line, we were invited to come back to make it up for bad service and McDonald's came through, we got yelled at by the manager, embarrased, long wait for food, missing food items, and pissy attitude by staff. Next time I get invited back I guess I gotta read the fine print or ask for what am I invited to come back for. Sorry that we don't have negative stars because this location would take them all.",1 star
Only go here because it's open late. Food not always the same presentation or great tasting..but it is McDonald's. What do you expect.... You know when you go there what you're getting. Cheap food..poor customer service.. And maybe your order correct.,2 stars
"They had a broken latte machine.  The kiosk already had our CC deposit.  It took very long to receive our CC refund because the manager had to perform the business, and the restaurant was overly crowded.  They used to make great cappuccinos, but it got to be too loud, and those machines broke more frequently than lattes'.",5 stars
There is a theme with drive thru only restaurant's cold food and watered down drinks and if don't check your bags well enough before you drive away and your order is wrong you can't just walk back inside and get it fixed you have get back in line and start all over again! Open up the lobby people,2 stars
Slow. Food often old.,3 stars
This is one of the busiest McDonald's I have ever seen. Very modern inside. Most people were getting food to go so there was plenty of room to sit but so many people waiting for food. At least it was very fresh!,4 stars
"If Mc D thinks Kiosk service is the future, I would SELL My Stock!

This place is ridiculously high compared to the McDonald's just down the street. $20 for what is normally $10. On top of it didn't even ask if I wanted any sauces with my chicken McNuggets. Do yourself a favor and drive the extra couple of miles to any other McDonald's,2 stars
Good for a quick bite on the go with a busy day right across the street from Old Town this place is got an indoor playground which is nice. The kids enjoyed it the one time we came in and stopped and let them play. Unfortunately the last time we came through the drive-thru and there was a vagrant near the one entrance so that was a little unsettling other than that has McDonald's go it was okay,3 stars
40 chicken nuggets and 2 large fries for 15 bucks!! Also the ice tea is the best in Florida,5 stars
So disappointed... I entered this restaurant only to be confronted with a computer taking my order..  which was Not working!! No one noticed we were having difficulty.  So frustrating. Wont come here again for a long time!,2 stars

Great workers were very helpful. Eating area play area were clean. Men's bathroom was quite messy and the toilet paper holder was torn off the wall. Overall will come again.,4 stars
Sat in drive thru for very long time to be told no fountain drinks no frappes no coffee and food was meh,2 stars
Nice place to eat anytime you want. They are very busy. People come by the bus loads to eat hamburgers all over. It's a tourist trap. Cheap and hot food. Your money goes far. Most people go there for a quick meal and internet which is free.,5 stars
"3 stars for being a clean and friendly McDonald's but it'll never be a 5 star stop because they NEVER have ice cream. Doesn't matter where you go there's a 90% chance they are out or the machine is down. Morning? Down. Afternoon? Down? Nighttime? Down. Halloween? Down. On Halloween?! Yes, completely down all night. I know that ice cream machines being down is a running joke but this location is the king of it.",3 stars
"The staff here is not friendly at all. Where I grew up, you greet somebody, or at least say something. The drinks tasted horrible.",1 star
"Absolutely Terrible Food ! No OPTIONS for Anything even remotely Healthy,  The staff is polite,  but McDonald's You WILL continue to lose business!  People are finally looking at All the disgusting ingredients that's in the production of your food. Even the yogurt has MORE SUGAR THAN A SUNDAY , I wouldn't even recommend the fries , Unless you want a Heart attack , with  a side of High blood pressure and Diabetes with a POSSIBLY of cancer, then okay go for it .",1 star

Seems like the more one goes to this location...the worse it gets....toasting an English muffin should not be a difficult task... it wouldn't be bad....but lying about toasting it .......Shame on them.....apparently after a certain hour it is..not a priority to make decent food for the public......or decent fries...not to mention a double cheeseburger... simply gross.. Good grief....this place is certainly disappearing from my list of quick stops...to keep going by  cause Checkers is right down the road...,1 star
Have to place your own order. They forgot some of our food. Bathrooms smelled. Play area still closed.,3 stars

"I have been staying at the Holiday Inn next door to the McDonald's for four days now. Every morning we walk over to McDonald's to get bacon, egg, and cheese biscuits and hash browns. EVERY SINGLE MORNING that we've went over there, we have gotten hard, rubbery, cold, biscuits. Their hash browns are hard as well, and there is so much grease that it runs down your fingers when you pick it up.

I called the manager and she was very polite and replaced my breakfast with ""better biscuits"". However, the replacement biscuits were undercooked. They were very doughy. I do not recommend this place to anyone. The convenience to the hotel is not worth the terrible food.",1 star
"Just went and got 4 McChicken, 1 Large French fry a medium one and a cheeseburger.

The entire order was old. French fries were saggy like and old lady titis. The McChicken tastes like they were cooked a month ago. Aaaah wait no coke because the machine was down. First is the shake machine and now the coke. Come on man. Worst MCDONALD Ever fuuuuck",1 star

I visited this McDonalds on my way home from Walt disney world with my kids 8 and 13. I went through the drive through so I could get back on the road to get home our order was not right onions on everything we asked for no onion and short a French fry. Also has no ketchup in the bag and I asked for more because our kids use a lot and was told no it was in the bag. I do not recommend the drive through.,2 stars
Horrible service. General manager was in the store at the time. Was punishing an employee in front of everybody. Should've been more professional and took him in the back area. I waited 10 minutes no one in front of me and no one in the drive thru and my food still was not fresh. Don't recommend this location unless you can't get to a different location.,2 stars

"I guess when you're in a tourist area you don't have to worry about pleasing your local customers for return business. Stale burger buns, cold and burnt french fries.  Medium fries box was about 2/3 full.  Drive thru employee didn't say two words to me beyond the price of my meal.",1 star
It's a good place for fast food,4 stars
The Asian looking manager killed my vibe. I was asking questions about their cafe drinks in a bubbly tone and he just replied in a really monotone voice. I was trying to make conversation and he just ignored me.... now I feel awkward as hell...,3 stars
The line for drive thru was out to the street! Not their fault it is not the first time. Once I got to pay point it was quick.,4 stars
I went through the drive-thru at this location and ordered a big Mac a large fry two McDoubles as well as a medium caramel frappe however when I return to my room the big Mac was missing as well as the cookies so I drove back up to the location I've now been sitting here over 20 minutes and nobody has come outside to let me know what was going on I would highly recommend finding another McDonald's to go to seeing as they don't seem to care about their customers,1 star
Not enough staff to take orders. While I had a very basic order it was wrong. Didn't make a big deal just left. Very clean restaurant however!! Also needs to have more English speaking associates,3 stars
"The worst McDonald's I've been to! Went in around 10 maybe 11 at night after visiting disney on the way back to our hotel. Went inside because the drive through line had at least 10 cars, no big deal. I was ordering a carryout. Anyways they forgot the chicken nuggets for the 10 piece chicken nugget meal. I wasnt about to bring my two little ones back out so I called the store. I told them what had happend and said I would be back sometime tomorrow afternoon and to just get it then (my boys love McDonald's) she said that would be fine and she would be there the next day. I asked her name but it couldn't really understand what she said because she was talking fast. Anyways I go back the day and told the lady at the drive through what happend, she didn't know what to do and had to get a manager the manager comes on and asks who I spoke to and I told her I didn't remember but she said to bring my receipt in and she would take care of it. Manager didn't believe me. I ended up just buying another one and I know its literally only a few dollars but it was the principal.",1 star

"Read down place has changed a lot! Getting to be excellent place to go!

Not good, new construction is nice. But understaffed. Even at 2-3am you can walk in and find over half of the tables covered with trays and garbage. Also the floors heavily littered. Yes you are supposed to buss your own table at a fast food restaurant, but alot of foreign/domestic vacationers are just filthy. They just drop food and wrappers everywhere. When they are done eating they just get up and leave.
Host/busser is needed for the dining area for the sloppy pigs. More register coverage for the guests. When a crowd of people have to go through one register while the kitchen staff waits for orders is inefficient.
I have had 2-3 errors in my 8 visits. First one was when they put extra mustard on burger instead of adding mayo. Second was they ran out of hot fudge and instead of telling me they used the coffee chocolate topping for my Sunday's (yes 2 of them).
I caught the first error quickly and was easily fixed properly by management before I left. The 2nd error wasn't caught till we where eating the Sunday's at home. I took one back as proof of the error to get a refund. At first they only wanted to refund one but with several minutes of bickering they refunded both. Yeah it was only $1 and some change but it was the principal.
I walk to and from the restaurant since I have no car it is about one mile away from my home. I always request 2 plastic bag's for my food because the one paper bag they put my 6-8 burgers fails halfway home. The 2nd one is for the 3 Sunday's.

Another epic failure, ordered 2 mcdouble no mustard and onions. 2 bacon mcdouble  and 2 mcdouble regular. Received the 2 mcdouble wo/mustard and onions no problem. 2 bacon mcdouble had no bacon and no mustard fail. 2 regular mcdouble had no mustard either fail. 2 large fries ordered and received 2 medium sized fries and 2 of the smallest sized fries I've ever seen (guess they where kids sized) fail. The 20 peice fry came without incident. Less than 1/2 of the whole order came correctly....

I used to love this location. It is the close one to my home. But lately the service has gone down hill. Mostly through the drive thru where I usually get most of my orders! New management or what? Please quit thanking me so much and get my order right. Oh and when I say two cremes and 4 splendas in my coffee get it right. This morning the sticker they put on the coffee said 3 cremes and 4 sugars. I am diabetic. I tested it and it was not right so I waited to get to work and put one more splenda thinking they had not put the right amount. Drank about half when I noticed the sticker. That coffee affected my health because of the sugar! Their is kore but why bore you. Hope they change.,3 stars

I work at Ponderosa Steakhouse next door to this McDonalds. I have visited this location many times. When there is no business and its slow the workers just stand around talking like nothing going on. I've tried to place my order many times in hopes that I'd receive my food fast enough to get my food and head to work next door before I have to clock in and start my shift. The management is slow and doesn't help out as I figured they wouldn't. My mother went here as well after dropping my off at work to only experience this as well. Many people have to wait foreverrrrr just to get a simple order. The last time I went I just ordered an ice coffee French vanilla and instead of handing me the ice coffee they placed it besides a counter and made me wait 12 minutes for it. I didn't ask anyone this time because im just feed up with this location. If you want McDonalds DO NOT! and I repeat DO NOT VISIT THIS LOCATION!!! They care more about drivethrew then there customers eating inside or taking it to go!!!!!! I'd rare this place 0 if I could.,1 star
Was given completely the wrong order after having to wait more then 10 minutes for what should have just been 2 burgers and fries. Called repeatedly to explain the error and got a busy tone every time.,1 star
"Terrible service. Manager laughed in my face when I told them I was not satisfied with my food and service. I ordered the big breakfast without hotcakes. The eggs were old and half the portion that I normally get at any other location, the soda was flat, the coffee was cold and the staff is rude. This place should be shut down. Absolutely the worst McDonalds I've ever been to in my life.",1 star
I always go out of my way to go to this McDonald's they always make their french fries right well the way I like them the food is always hot service is always good looks like they're taking all covid precautions I recommend this one across from old Town,5 stars
Worst experience ever long wait. Then when I got to window waited again. Till I literally had to ask WHY AM I STILL WAITING FOR MY FOOD. as bags were sitting right in front of me.. Total wait time at this McDonald's was like 20 mins. RIDICULOUS..,1 star
chicken nuggets had a lot of those chewy fat pieces and was stiff. if ur gonna eat here get a burger or sumn. Fries were tasty tho!,3 stars
The line was long but they moved us right along all employees were friendly and courteous the food was fresh and hot I will definitely go back to this McDonald's again,4 stars
Sitting in line at drive thru for 30 minutes.  Inside closed for whatever reason.  If your drive thru has a 30 min wait then why would walk up be closed? The owner of this place is an idiot.,1 star
"Drive thru was closed today. 10/9 at 3:45am. Is it still 24 hours if the drive thru is closed and the dining room as well? Park your car and wait, or drive 7 min down the road to the next one....oh the options.",1 star
They forgot about me in the drive-thru after asking me to pull to the third window. If I could leave 0 stars I would. Finally went into the store to see my bag sitting on the counter for so long it needed to be remade.,1 star
"In a pinch, it's food. My burger was slipped all over the inside of the wrapper and floating in grease. I just ate the dry parts. My husband's chicken sandwich came without any of the toppings and completely drenched in mystery dressing. Fries were super old and had that old grease fishy taste. Sodas (coke and Dr Pepper) were next to flat.

We were starving after a long hot day so, we just ate it and tried not to think about it.",1 star
"The Service is bad in special the drivetrue they never give the food correct and management are worse that the bad service that people receive they do not know the meaning of customer service. That McDonald's need to change does managers or give them a good training in customer service, courtesy and Ethical!",1 star
"One of the better McDonalds.  Fast, accurate, clean.",5 stars
"I love McDonalds.  Been in my life all my life.  No bigger disappointment than waiting for my meal and getting lukewarm fries.  This one gave me lukewarm fries after I waited 15 minutes for my meal.  I hold McDonalds to a very high standard and, for me, the fries make the meal.  No exception!!",4 stars
"I used my McDonalds app and got some crazy discounts... but I'm still unsatisfied. The food is sad and old. Mr. Happy at the Expo looked like his life was over and didnt know anything about customer service.  The iced coffee was basically milk and creamer minus the coffee. I know this is fast food but damn, you guys didnt even try today.",1 star
Breakfast was good and the meals were delivered to the window accurately.,4 stars
"Slowest, most under staffed McDonald's I have ever been, everyone honking on the drive trun, people screaming they have been waiting forever, very stressful environment.",2 stars
"Manages to allow something to screw up anything Everytime! I came here for 6 days in total. Normally I do not eat at McDonald's but this place is very close to where I'm staying.

They have new electronic ordering system using touchpad on giant vertical screen. Still gets my order wrong 80 percent of time... What? Asks me what drink I want. Then I just get the cup so why ask me? One day, I leave the locator number on table while I go bathroom. Locator and food is gone. Takes me a while to get it sorted out.forgets my drink {again)

One sauce dispensor just explodes pop knocks the container out of my hand under strong pressure. Gets little sauce on my clothes, not too bad but Jesus Christ... One night, lot of drinks do not work except for coke (yuk)  few other things not worth mentioning. They get swamped a lot nad hardly can keep up.

Otherwise place is relatively new looking as well as private bathroom with your own stall and sink. Clean.",2 stars
"Very clean and well organized McDonald's.  McDonald's even has an indoor play area for kids, with a slide. I would highly recommend eating here on a rainy vacation day to allow your children a chance run off a little energy.",5 stars
Very disappointed that there was no indoor seating. Doors were locked. Drive-thru only. Needed to sit at a table and eat. Decided to eat elsewhere.,2 stars
I ordered off the screen. It said take number and they will bring it to the table. Well the manager got my order together and got it totally wrong and then stood up there call the number and made me come get it. Did not receive any of my drinks. Went back up there a day the manager was not nice at all. Will not visit again.,1 star
Don't like to order on a machine,3 stars
Service was fast but quality of food was disappointing on both trips,4 stars

The manager Cassandra is very rude to customers and very unprofessional they did not acknowledge people standing at the register and then I asked if they were taking orders they reply with that's why the kiosks are there two customers walked.

"Went to eat at 3:40 am.  And the guy tells me that there's only mc chicken sandwiches. And that's all.  And if I wanted breakfast, I'd have to wait till 4 am.  Ridiculous.",1 star
3 trips here for a collective total of 45 minutes spent... They can't figure out the two lane ordering system... This is not FAST food by any stretch of the imagination... McDonald's are everywhere... Find a different one.,1 star

Food is slow to arrive 17 mins for a mc double...  Most of the Management team is horrible and rude. The young shorter Hispanic lady manager is an asset and needs to be recognized..,3 stars
"Right across the road from Seralago Hotel, this was a great spot to walk over to and grab a quick, cheap breakfast. It's also situated in the strip of gift shops and across from ""Old Town"" amusement park, so it is very convenient to eat at when visiting those places.",4 stars
Not so much fast food but still good food.,4 stars
Slow service. Car park was rammed and difficult to move around due to the drive through vehicles being in the way!!(not really the fault of the restaurant except they could mark the lanes out better in the car park).,3 stars
Pretty cool place! Very busy as expected but they served pretty bb fast.,5 stars
Delicious hamburgers that definitely weigh on your belly on your way to bed and if you want to take a quick nap on a full belly  McDonald's is the place to go,4 stars

Only place open late on a week night so the wait time was extremely long.,4 stars
"Great place to have a cup of coffee. If you are on the keto diet, McDonald's has whipped butter. Yes it's real butter. Along with half and half. You could ask for whipped cream. Believe me there coffee tastes much better with butter  and cream in it .  They do not have Stevia . They can make you a keto breakfast. Which is eggs bacon and sausage layered.",4 stars
"Understaffed,   slow as a result.    Those that are working,  are courteous and apologetic..  what I don't understand is considering the location,  (Disney area)  that this McDonald's isn't better staffed.",3 stars

"I ordered a caramel frappe with no whip cream. Upon getting my Carmel frappe there was whip cream. They were upset when I requested they fix my order to meet the way I ordered. When they handed it back to my husband, they had scooped out the whip cream and another quarter of the frappe. Very rude about it as well.",1 star

"I've been going to this location most of my life since it's not far from my home. So I've seen this McDonald's go through a lot of changes. The employees here generally have decent attitudes, there are a few that tend to be rude. The store is also dirty a lot of the time. It's a very busy location, and maybe it's from having a lot of foot traffic, but the floor is usually dirty, the drink station will be filthy and wet and sticky, the ketchup area will be out of ketchup, and/or there will be ketchup all over the place, too. The tables tend to be dirty, too, you usually have to clean off your own table. Also they have those light up tables that kids like, and when I go in there with my kid there will be homeless people sitting there, and they won't be eating, and they'll have their stuff all over the place and sit there for hours. And mind you, these tables seat about 8 and there will be one homeless person sitting there. My kid will want to sit there so he can play with the lights, and I'll have to tell him he can't because this one homeless person sitting at one of the largest table, is camping there. The employees don't seem to care at all that these people are doing this despite them sitting there for hours, but buying anything. Sometimes they'll even be sleeping at the table.
The kid's play area is also really crappy. They have nothing for the kids to play on like a playplace. They have 4 of these really crappy touch screen games things that rarely work properly, or at all. When I was a kid they had a huge playplace, which they took out when they remodeled the store. It even had N64's at one point, along with the playplace. But they took it all out and replaced it with a ""sitting"" place instead of a playplace. It's really awful.
So, all in all, this McDonald's is dirty, has a lot of homeless people that practically live there, and isn't really kid friendly. The food is okay, as long as it's hot food (I get a lot of cold food or my order is wrong), and the employees are generally friendly, but there have been a lot of times where the managers are rather lackluster, meaning that you can tell they don't want to be there. This location needs a lot of work. And they need to do something about the amount of homeless people that hang around in there. There hasn't been a single time I've gone there that there wasn't at least one homeless person there taking up the interactive table that kids want to sit at, with all their dirty things sitting on the table itself. The table is by the front counter, too and you can often times smell the homeless person that's sitting there the whole time you're waiting in line and waiting for your food and while you get your drinks. It is not kid friendly at all at this store. With the store being in a nicer part of town you'd expect quite a bit more cleanliness.",2 stars
"This location was awful today. They rang up our order wrong, then gave it to us still wrong. Took over 15 min to get our order and we had to ask for our drink cups so we could at least get our drinks while waiting. As we stood there, we saw almost every person have a problem with their orders. The person at the register was messing up every order and the back kept making the wrong things. Worst visit ever.",1 star
"Horrible service. Drive thru speaker was not lit up/broken and when I pulled up to order, I was greeted rudely. I asked if I could order at the window and the lady said ""i guess so."" My order was also wrong and the bacon burger came with no bacon. BAD place to visit during a 3rd shift!!",1 star
The food at this store is always done right. They seem to run a good kitchen. Things are served at the right temp and 99% of the time taste great. Unlike other stores where you've got about a 60% chance of great food.,5 stars

"There always seems to be a rush and not in a good way. Obvious rush hours are meant to be hectic. But when most of the staff are young and  teenage-ish  and rightfully so because age and mindset it a bit understandable.  But not getting right items with orders, or taking longer the should be to get final order is saying something.

"Two employees preparing the food simply didn't wear a mask. I am highly dissatisfied with the effort put into enforcing the wearing of a mask. Why during this pandemic, which has not settled in the least, have you not have had a keen eye on employees in order to safeguard the wellbeing of your customers. It's unacceptable to have this lack of care while thousands of healthcare workers are having to work day in and out (With a mask on!) To save lives. Consider this message before you enter this McDonald's (Or any restaurant really) because the meal you get can very well be the deciding factor on whether or not you live in weeks time.

The food was at McDonald's standards. But the upkeep of the restaurant was less than average. Garbage cans overflowing. Foot prints all over the floor and the fountain drink dispenser wasn't draining. Its had about an inch of fluid in the waste catcher. You couldn't even set your cups down to fill them up.,2 stars
"This McDonald's, is a McDonald's that we've been frequenting on Wednesdays, we go after dinner, for a little desert with a fairly large group, and we had an excellent experience with a cashier, very friendly and was quick to ensure we had everything we needed. I normally get the turtle brownie sundae, a very delicious treat.",5 stars
"Pretty much the definition of ""meh"" and ""ok"" service. Had the unpleasant pleasure of having an older lady by the name of Precious take my order and was just awful. She had the worst ""I don't care"" kind of attitude. Worst yet,  I believe she was the shift last or manager.

Either way,  if you don't care for the customer service, the food is usually on par.",2 stars

"Went to grab some breakfast here since Chik Fila looked closed. Placed order for 2 Bacon/Egg/Cheese Biscuits and 3 showed up on the screen and the female on the intercom was quite inconvenienced to correct my order. Waited a minute, but when the items didn't appear on the screen, I said ""Ma'am?"" and her response was ""YEA?!"" in a condescending, scathing tone. I said never mind and got out of there. Heifer needs a reality check.",1 star

HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I ordered a cone and it was a tiny pitiful looking excuse for a cone so I asked the manager [who made it & handed it to me] to remake it the correct size and way. He said 50 cents..it looked like a childs cone..he said you can pay 50 cents or take the cone..I kept insisting he remake it..he suggested to refund my money and I took it and went to Wendy's!! it was crazy how rude the manager and the staff were. I've worked for mcds before and the service I received was extremely below par. Never going to this mcds again.,3 stars
Very good,5 stars
